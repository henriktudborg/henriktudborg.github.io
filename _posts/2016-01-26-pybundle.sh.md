I've been experimenting a bit with the new [`zipapp`][zipapp] module
in python 3.5.

[(Yes, it's 3.5, I use 3.5 now, 3.5 is cool)][fez]

From the documentation:

> This module provides tools to manage the creation of zip files containing Python code, which can be executed directly by the Python interpreter. The module provides both a Command-Line Interface and a Python API.

So say we have written a little CLI tool. We can now package this up as a single
file and execute it. Neat!

## Here is how it works.

First thing to know: If you place a `__main__.py`, you can execute the directory (package) with `python`.

Our directory looks like this

```
app
├── __main__.py
├── otherfile.py
└── requirements.txt
```

and our `__main__.py` like this

```py
print("hello world")
```

We can now run python with the `app` directory as argument:

```
$> python app
hello world
```

Another neat feature is that it works even if you zip the app directory.

```bash
$> pushd app
~/src/demo/app ~/src/demo
$> zip -r ../app.pyz *
  adding: __main__.py (stored 0%)
  adding: requirements.txt (stored 0%)
$> popd
~/src/demo
# Now let's run the archive
$> python app.pyz
hello world
```

We can even add a shebang to the start of the file:

```bash
$> echo '#!/usr/bin/env python' > app.cmd
$> cat app.pyz >> app.cmd 
$> chmod +x app.cmd
$> ./app.cmd
hello world
```

And this is how we produce a single-file python executable.

You've been able to execute a zipfile with python since before time
(it is present in 2.6, so it is _oooold_).
So you should be able to use this just about anywhere you have a somewhat
updated python version.

## In Python 3.5

New in Python 3.5 is the [`zipapp`][zipapp] module, which wraps all
this functionality in a nice little module.
So instead of all the above, we can now just do:

```bash
$> python3.5 -m zipapp --python '/usr/bin/env python' --output app.pyz app
$> ./app.pyz
hello world
```

Which does pretty much what we did above.


## Dependencies

Of course this only bundles our _own_ code, what if we have dependencies?
Sorry, you'll have to bundle them yourself.
Luckily, this is super easy!

Simply install your dependencies inside your application directory and
add it to your `sys.path`.

You could do it like:

```bash
$> python -m pip install --prefix ./app click
Collecting click
  Using cached click-6.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl
Installing collected packages: click
Successfully installed click
```

Resulting in a directory structure like this:

```
app
├── lib
│   └── python2.7
│       └── site-packages
│           ├── click
│           └── click-6.2.dist-info
├── __main__.py
└── requirements.txt
```

(note that i used `python2.7`)


and in your `__main__.py`, add it to your `sys.path`

```py
import sys
import os
sys.path.append(
    os.path.join(
        os.path.dirname(__file__),
        'lib',
        'python%d.%d' % (sys.version_info.major, sys.version_info.minor),
        'site-packages'
    )
)
```

And you should now be able to load click.

```bash
$> python app
<module 'click' from '/home/tbug/src/pybundle/app/lib/python2.7/site-packages/click/__init__.pyc'>
```

Like always, path hacking feels a little dirty, but we'll manage.

## PyBundle.sh

I wrapped the above examples in a [neat little shell-script][pybundle.sh] that does all of
this for you.

It also contains a hello-world [`click`][click] example.

## Conclusion

Now, is this useful? Where should we use it?

I'm not sure. But it _is_ really cool! :)
