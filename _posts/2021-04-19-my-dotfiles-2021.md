title: "My Dotfiles 2021"

---

This is a walkthrough of my [dotfiles repository][repository].

This is mostly intended as a reference post I can use to point people to when
they ask how I do a specific thing, but you might be able to find some fun little
tweaks you didn't know about.

A lot has happened since I started the repository to keep track of my dotfiles across machines in 2014.
These days I'm using them mostly on MacOS, but I do have a small XPS 15 running Arch Linux that also
see a bit of use.

We are skipping my tmux configuration as that is probably a post in itself.

## psqlrc

I have a custom `psqlrc` file that for when I use the `psql` tool.

```sql
\set QUIET 1
\pset null '¤' -- Show NULL values as the ¤ character. Much easier to spot.
\pset linestyle unicode -- Nicer borders
\pset border 2 -- show table frame border

-- Prompt line itself, like Bash's PS1 and PS2
\set PROMPT1 '%[%033[1m%][%n@%/] %R%# '
-- SELECT * FROM<enter>. %R shows what type of input it expects.
\set PROMPT2 '... %R %# '

-- Always time things
\timing

-- Expanded table formatting mode = auto
\x auto

-- On error, don't auto-rollback when in interactive mode
\set ON_ERROR_ROLLBACK interactive

-- Be verbose
\set VERBOSITY verbose

-- Histfile seperate per database
\set HISTFILE ~/.psql_history- :DBNAME
\set HISTCONTROL ignoredups

-- auto-completed keywords will be uppercased
\set COMP_KEYWORD_CASE upper
\unset QUIET
```

## Bash

The meat of my dotfiles is the `bashrc`, which configures my bash that I use
every day.
I've tweaked this system over the last 5 years and this is where I'm at today.

Most of these I've probably grabbed from someone elses system and tweaked them as needed.

### Architecture

The `bashrc` file is designed to be either symlinked into place or sourced
from your own bashrc script.
On my current workstation I source it from `~/.bashrc` to mix it with some local configuration.

The `bashrc` file sets up the library that I use to work with my dotfiles,
and the rest of the configuration is stored in a `bashrc.d/` directory next to the
`bashrc` script.

The library consists of 4 bash functions:

- `dotfiles_directory`
- `dotfiles_platform`
- `dotfiles_match`
- `dotfiles_source`

**`dotfiles_directory`** outputs the directory that the `bashrc` file is located in.
This works across symlinks, which is why it is a bit complicated.


**`dotfiles_platform`** outputs the current "platform" as a normalized string.
I use this for configuration that is only relevant on certain platforms.

**`dotfiles_match`** outputs all configuration files that matches a pattern,
or every relevant file if not pattern is given.
It uses filenames from the configuration directory to check this.
Valid filenames match `<name>.<platform | all>.sh`.
The files are returned in sorted order by name.

**`dotfiles_source`** Takes an optional pattern just line the above function, and sources files that match. If the debug environment variable `DOTFILES_DEBUG` is set to true then it will do so while timing the source.
If a source command fails it will write an error about it to STDERR.

Finally, the `bashrc` file calls `dotfiles_source` with no pattern,
which will source all configuration files relevant for the current platform.

### Dotfiles

If the order of sourcing is important, the files are named `<nn>.<name>.<platform>.sh`
which will source those files first.

Files that most be sourced last are prefixed with `zz`.
I currently don't have any of those.

#### Aliases

The first file is my alias file.
I don't tend to use aliases a lot but I have a few:

```bash
if command -v nvim >/dev/null; then
    alias vim=nvim
fi
if command -v pgcli >/dev/null; then
    alias pg=pgcli
fi

alias v=vim # I'm really lazy
alias week="date +%GW%V" # e.g. 2020W42
alias cal="cal -Nw3sDK" # I prefer this
```

The `command -v pgcli >/dev/null;` checks if `pgcli` exists.
I'm doing this a lot in my dotfiles to only perform configuration if some
command is available on `$PATH`.


#### Path

I've tinkered with `PATH` so much that I've made a simply utility to work with them.
The file `00.path.all.sh` defines two helper functions that the rest of the
configuration will use to work with `PATH`:

```bash
path_prepend () {
    if ! [[ "$PATH" = *"$1"* ]]; then
        export PATH="$1:$PATH"
    fi
    return 0
}
path_append () {
    if ! [[ "$PATH" = *"$1"* ]]; then
        export PATH="$PATH:$1"
    fi
    return 0
}
```

It also defines my python paths. I should have moved these to my python
config but I haven't yet :)

```bash
if command -v python3 >/dev/null; then
    path_append "$(python3 -c 'import site;print(site.USER_BASE)')/bin"
fi
if command -v python2 >/dev/null; then
    path_append "$(python2 -c 'import site;print(site.USER_BASE)')/bin"
fi
```

I normally use a single python2 and python3 on my system so this works fine.


I also have a Darwin specific path configuration at `01.path.darwin.sh`.
This is our first platform specific file:

```bash
if [ -x /usr/libexec/path_helper ]; then
    eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s`
fi
if [[ -d /usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin ]]; then
    path_prepend "/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin"
fi
if [[ -d /usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnuman ]]; then
    export MANPATH="/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnuman:$MANPATH"
fi
```

I have Coreutils installed through brew, and this handles
the path and manual paths for me.


#### Private Configuration

On most platforms I have secret configuration (passwords, tokens and such) that
I don't want to commit to my _public_ dotfile repo.
I've made a habbit of placing such secrets in a `~/.bash_private` file,
and have a dotfile `02.private.all.sh` that simply source that if it exists:

```bash
if [[ -f $HOME/.bash_private ]]; then
    source $HOME/.bash_private
fi
```


#### HOME paths

Because different tools can't agree on where to put there executables in my
home folder, I have this catch-all kind of "just prepend bin/ to PATH please"

```bash
if [[ -d $HOME/bin/ ]]; then
    path_prepend "$HOME/bin"
fi
if [[ -d $HOME/.bin/ ]]; then
    path_prepend "$HOME/.bin"
fi
if [[ -d $HOME/.local/bin/ ]]; then
    path_prepend "$HOME/.local/bin"
fi
```

#### Sublime Text on MacOS

If sublime is installed, add it's `bin/` to the path.

```bash
if [ -d "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin" ]; then
  path_append "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin"
fi
```

#### asdf version manager

I use [asdf][asdf] for a lot of my tool version management.
Currently I use it for `erlang`, `elixir`, `nodejs`, `ruby`.

The dotfile itself is simple: the tool itself and bash completions for it:

```bash
if [[ -d $HOME/.asdf ]]; then
  . $HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh
  . $HOME/.asdf/completions/asdf.bash
fi
```

#### AWS CLI

This enables bash completions for the `aws` CLI.

```bash
if command -v aws_completer >/dev/null; then
    complete -C aws_completer aws
fi
```

#### Bash Completion

This sources the bash-completion project if it is installed.

Note that brew installs these in it's prefix, so this won't work
if you've installed it via brew.
I have a section further down for that.

```bash
if [ -f /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]; then
  . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
fi
```

#### Docker Completion

This enables bash completion for the docker command when installed via the
[Docker for Mac][docker-for-mac] project.

```bash
if [ -f /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/etc/docker.bash-completion ]; then
  . /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/etc/docker.bash-completion
fi
```

#### EDITOR environment variable

This sets up the `EDITOR` environment variable such that if the
`subl` command exists, we'll use that, otherwise if `vim` exists, we'll use that.

I love Sublime Text and it has been my primary editor for most of my professional
career, but in a pinch I'm fine with vim as well.

```bash
if command -v subl >/dev/null; then
    export EDITOR="subl --wait"
elif command -v vim >/dev/null; then
    export EDITOR="vim"
fi
```

#### Erlang and Elixir

Some versions of erlang requires a kernel flag to be set to enable the shell
history. This is an absolute pain to remember but luckily you can set those
in an environment variable as well, so this does that.
It also adds the `~/.mix/escripts` path to my `PATH`

```bash
if command -v erl >/dev/null || command -v iex >/dev/null; then
    export ERL_AFLAGS="-kernel shell_history enabled"
    ESCRIPTS_PATH="/Users/tbug/.mix/escripts"
    if [[ -d "$ESCRIPTS_PATH" ]]; then
      path_append "$ESCRIPTS_PATH"
    fi
fi
```

#### Grep Aliases

I want my grep in color.

```bash
if command -v grep >/dev/null; then
    alias grep='grep --color=auto'
    alias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'
    alias egrep='egrep --color=auto'
fi
```

#### Homebrew Bash Completions

This handles the bash completion project installed via brew.

```bash
if command -v brew > /dev/null && [ -f $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion ]; then
    . $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion
elif command -v brew > /dev/null && [ -f $(brew --prefix)/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]; then
    . $(brew --prefix)/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
fi
```


### Fake a slow network with ipfw

It's been years since I've used this, but I remember it being really useful.

```bash
if command -v ipfw >/dev/null; then
    #fake slow network
    alias slowNetwork='sudo ipfw pipe 1 config bw 350kbit/s plr 0.05 delay 500ms && sudo ipfw add pipe 1 dst-port http'
    alias flushNetwork='sudo ipfw flush'
fi
```

#### kubectl

My kubectl dotfile configuration is a bit complicated:

```bash
if command -v kubectl >/dev/null; then
    function k {
        local BLUE='\033[0;34m'
        local BOLD="\033[1m"
        local CLEAR='\033[0m'
        local context="$(awk '/^current-context:/{print $2}' $HOME/.kube/config)"
        printf "${BLUE}${BOLD}$context${CLEAR}\n" >&2
        kubectl "$@"
    }
    if [[ -d $HOME/.kube ]] && [[ ! -f $HOME/.kube/completion.bash.inc ]]; then
        kubectl completion bash > $HOME/.kube/completion.bash.inc
    fi
    # if the kubectl completion is not loaded, load it:
    if ! command -v __start_kubectl >/dev/null; then
        source $HOME/.kube/completion.bash.inc
    fi
    # make kubectl completions work for our short-name function `k` as well
    if command -v __start_kubectl >/dev/null; then
        complete -o default -F __start_kubectl k
    fi
    if command -v kubectx >/dev/null; then
        alias kx="kubectx"
        _kx_contexts () {
            local curr_arg;
            curr_arg=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]};
            COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W "- $(kubectl config get-contexts --output='name')" -- $curr_arg ))
        }
        complete -o default -F _kx_contexts kx
    fi

    # if krew plugin exists, add it to bin path
    if [[ -d "${HOME}/.krew" ]]; then
        path_append "${HOME}/.krew/bin"
    fi

    # if helm exists
    if command -v helm >/dev/null; then
        if [[ -d $HOME/.kube ]] && [[ ! -f $HOME/.kube/helm-completion.bash.inc ]]; then
            helm completion bash > $HOME/.kube/helm-completion.bash.inc
        fi
        if ! command -v __start_helm >/dev/null; then
            source $HOME/.kube/helm-completion.bash.inc
        fi
    fi
fi
```

First, I have a bash function `k` that wraps `kubectl`.
It's purpose is both as an alias so that I can just type `k` for `kubectl`,
but it also prints what context I'm currently using so I might notice that I'm running
something in the wrong environment.

There is also some bash completions in there, both for `kubectl` itself,
but also for the `k` function so I get completions for that as well.

Then I have a [`kubectx`][kubectx] alias `kx` and a completion for it as well.

Then a bit for putting [`krew`][krew]'s `bin/` onto the PATH.

And finally some [`helm`][helm] stuff that handles loading bash completions
for `helm`.


#### Manual pages

Adding some color to my `man` pages.

```bash
# colorized man pages
man() {
    env \
        LESS_TERMCAP_md=$'\e[1;36m' \
        LESS_TERMCAP_me=$'\e[0m' \
        LESS_TERMCAP_se=$'\e[0m' \
        LESS_TERMCAP_so=$'\e[1;40;92m' \
        LESS_TERMCAP_ue=$'\e[0m' \
        LESS_TERMCAP_us=$'\e[1;32m' \
            man "$@"
}
```

#### Nix Hack

I've been toying a bit with Nix on-off, and I had issues with searching for
packages. So I built a caching search function.
Better tools exist to do this, and I don't recommend stealing this, but for reference:

```bash
if [[ -d $HOME/.nix-profile ]]; then
    source $HOME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh

    export NIX_SEARCH_CACHE="$HOME/.cache/nix-search-cache"
    nix-search () {
      if ! [[ -e "$NIX_SEARCH_CACHE" ]]; then
        echo "nix-search cache is empty, populating..." >&2
        nix-search --update
      fi
      while (( "$#" )); do
        case "$1" in
          -h|--help)
            echo "nix-search - cache and search in nix package names." >&2
            echo "  search is done with 'grep -i'" >&2
            echo "usage:" >&2
            echo "  nix-search (-u|--update)  updates the nix-search cache" >&2
            echo "  nix-search <grep args>    searches the nix-search cache" >&2
            return 1
            ;;
          -u|--update)
            echo "nix-search updating cache..." >&2
            nix-env -qaP '*' > "$NIX_SEARCH_CACHE"
            local ret=$?
            echo "packages available for searching: $(cat "$NIX_SEARCH_CACHE" | wc -l)" >&2
            return $ret
            ;;
          --) # end argument parsing
            shift
            break
            ;;
          -*|--*=) # unsupported flags
            echo "Error: Unsupported flag $1" >&2
            return 1
            ;;
          *) # preserve positional arguments
            local params="$params $1"
            shift
            ;;
        esac
      done
      if [[ "$(stat -f %c "$NIX_SEARCH_CACHE")" -lt "$(( $(date +%s) - 86400 ))" ]]; then
        echo "nix-search cache needs updating, run nix-search -u" >&2
      fi
      grep -i "$params" "$NIX_SEARCH_CACHE"
    }

fi

# will make bash-completion happy when installed via nix
export XDG_DATA_DIRS="$HOME/.nix-profile/share:${XDG_DATA_DIRS:-/usr/local/share:/usr/share}"

# bash completions from nix:
if [[ -f $HOME/.nix-profile/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]]; then
    source $HOME/.nix-profile/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
fi

# git bash completions from git package
if [[ -f $HOME/.nix-profile/share/git/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash ]]; then
    source $HOME/.nix-profile/share/git/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash
fi
```

At the end there is some loading of completions when packages are installed via nix.

#### NodeJS

```bash
if [[ -d "$HOME/.npm/global/bin" ]]; then
  path_append "$HOME/.npm/global/bin"
fi
```

#### NVM

I don't really use nvm anymore since I switched to `asdf`, but this is a good example
of some of the lazy-loading of things I've done to speed up booting my bash shell:

```bash
# care about nvm, only if .nvm folder exists
if [[ -d "$HOME/.nvm" ]]; then
    export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
    nvm () {
        echo 'lazy loading nvm...' >&2
        unset -f nvm
        # this works on my arch machines with the nvm package installed
        if [[ -f "/usr/share/nvm/init-nvm.sh" ]]; then
            source /usr/share/nvm/init-nvm.sh
        # this works on my mac with nvm installed through brew
        elif [[ -f "/usr/local/opt/nvm/nvm.sh" ]]; then
            source "/usr/local/opt/nvm/nvm.sh"
        else
          echo "nvm doesn't seen to be present." >&2
          return 1
        fi
        nvm "$@"
    }
fi
```
This defines a function `nvm` that - when invoked - will unset itself and look
for `nvm` in the different places I have it across my machines and source it in.

The reason for doing this is that `nvm` was painfully slow to load, and usually
I don't need it, so paying an extra second in bash loading time is not worth it.

#### OpenShift Completion

Almost same story as with NVM. I don't use openshift anymore (I had a brief encouter at work)

What I did here is wrapping the completion in a lazy loader.
The reason is - again - that calling `oc completion bash` was a bit slow and I rarely
needed it.

This might be useful to you if you want to lazy-load your own bash completions.

```bash
if command -v oc >/dev/null; then
  # lazy-load completions for oc
  __fake_oc_completer () {
    complete -r oc
    unset -f __fake_oc_completer
    source <(oc completion bash)
    __start_oc "$@"
  }
  complete -F __fake_oc_completer oc
fi
```

#### Pager

This file used to be bigger, but currently it contains some pager configuration for
psql if [`pspg`][pspg] is installed.

Side-note: if you don't know [`pspg`][pspg] you should give it a look.
It's a really good pager for tabular content.

```bash
if command -v pspg >/dev/null; then
    export PSQL_PAGER="pspg"
fi
```

#### Prompt

The file `prompt.all.sh` defines my bash prompt (`PS1` and friends)

Here it is in full:

```bash
function __fix_stdout_nonblock_bug () {
    # some tool somewhere keeps messing up my stdout.
    # It's most likely a nodejs tool, at least I've seen nodejs do this multiple times,
    # however something somewhere in my pipeline does it incosistently but often
    # enough that it is so annoying that I want to make sure it doesn't happen.
    # Hence this hack.
    # This python snippet "fixes" the issue, unsetting NONBLOCK mode if it is already set.
    # Might be worth compiling a tiny C program to do it but this seems Good Enough for now.
    if command -v python >/dev/null; then
        python -c 'import os,sys,fcntl; flags = fcntl.fcntl(sys.stdout, fcntl.F_GETFL); fcntl.fcntl(sys.stdout, fcntl.F_SETFL, flags&~os.O_NONBLOCK);'
    else
        return 1
    fi
}

function __prompt_command () {
    local LASTEXIT="$?"

    # Fix a super annoying bug I keep seeing but can't figure out how to correct.
    # some nodejs tool somewhere leaves stdout in nonblock mode which messes up
    # other tools. So fix it ON EACH PROMPT!

    export PS2="${r}  ${status}${s}\$${venv}${awsenv}>${r} "
}

if ! type -t __git_ps1 > /dev/null; then
    if [[ -f /usr/share/git/git-prompt.sh ]]; then
        . /usr/share/git/git-prompt.sh
    elif [[ -f $HOME/.nix-profile/share/git/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh ]]; then
        . $HOME/.nix-profile/share/git/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh
    fi
fi

export PROMPT_COMMAND=__prompt_command  # Func to gen PS1 after CMDs
```

This file contains all my prompt related things.
Parts of this file dates all the way back to the start of this repo, 2014.

This is how it looks when rendered:

```
╭─(08:25:01) het@hetmbp ~/src/dotfiles [master=] [<k8s-context>]
╰─(0) $>
```

But in color, of course.

The prompt is a two-line prompt.
The top information line shows

- the time
- current working directory
- user and host
- git branch and status if applicable
- currently selected Kubernetes context

And the second line shows

- exit status of last command
- current python virtualenv if applicable
- currently selected AWS profile if applicable
- the prompt.

I've used this two-line prompt format since 2018 and I'm still pretty happy with it.


#### Ruby

Some Ruby hack that I don't use anymore since switching completely to asdf for
Ruby version management.

```bash
if ! command -v asdf >/dev/null; then
  # when asdf is installed don't do this ruby stuff because asdf will
  # most likely be managing this.
  if command -v ruby >/dev/null && command -v gem >/dev/null; then
      if [[ -f /tmp/ruby_gem_home ]]; then
          export GEM_HOME="$(cat /tmp/ruby_gem_home)"
      else
          # move GEM_HOME into home dir. Global install is messy.
          export GEM_HOME="$(ruby -r rubygems -e 'puts Gem.user_dir')"
          echo "$GEM_HOME" > /tmp/ruby_gem_home
      fi
      # prepend, because osx has some native ruby stuff that we cant really touch
      path_prepend "$GEM_HOME/bin"
  fi
fi
```

This checks if `ruby` and `gem` is present, and if so, defines `GEM_HOME`.
I also cache the `GEM_HOME` because invoking Ruby to get the `Gem.user_dir` is
painfully slow.

I also prepend the `bin/` folder in the `GEM_HOME` to `PATH` so that it's
picked first.


#### Rust Cargo Path

I've toyed a bit with rust, and also have utilities installed
via cargo. This simply appends the global cargo `bin/` to my PATH.

```bash
# Add cargo bin to path
if [[ -d "$HOME/.cargo/bin" ]]; then
    path_append "$HOME/.cargo/bin"
fi
```

#### Scaleway CLI Bash Completion

At work we have some infrastructure running at [Scaleway][scaleway].
They have a decent CLI that I use, and this defines auto-completion for it.

```bash
if command -v scw >/dev/null; then
  _scw() {
    _get_comp_words_by_ref -n = cword words
    output=$(scw autocomplete complete bash -- "$COMP_LINE" "$cword" "${words[@]}")
    COMPREPLY=($output)
    # apply compopt option and ignore failure for older bash versions
    [[ $COMPREPLY == *= ]] && compopt -o nospace 2> /dev/null || true
    return
  }
  complete -F _scw scw
fi
```

#### smux: ssh + tmux

I have a dedicated bash function that I've named `smux` for doing `ssh`+`tmux`.
It's a shortcut for running `ssh` and then `tmux` once you get a session,
which is something I do many times in a day.

I've used the default session name of `0` so that if I for some reason
would `ssh` in, and then run `tmux attach` it would still attach to the expected session.

I also wrote a completion function for it, which will use hosts defined
in `~/.ssh/config` and hosts found in `~/.ssh/known_hosts` as completions.

```bash
if command -v ssh >/dev/null; then
  smux () {
    if [[ "$#" -eq 0 ]]; then
      echo -e "SSH to <destination> and attach to a tmux session.\nAny argument is passed to ssh.\n\nusage: smux <destination> [...ssh opts]" >&2
      return 1
    fi
    ssh -t ${@} -- "tmux new-session -ADs0"
  }
  _smux() 
  {
      local cur prev opts
      COMPREPLY=()
      cur="${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}"
      prev="${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD-1]}"
      opts=$(
        awk '/^host/ && $2 !~ /\*/ {print $2}' ~/.ssh/config &&
        awk '!/\[/{split($1, a, ",");for(i in a){print a[i]}}' ~/.ssh/known_hosts | sort -u
      )
      COMPREPLY=( $(compgen -W "$opts" -- ${cur}) )
      return 0
  }
  complete -F _smux smux
fi
```

The meat of it is the line:

```bash
ssh -t ${@} -- "tmux new-session -ADs0"
```

Which will force a TTY and pass any arguments you gave `smux` along to `ssh`.
It will then run

```bash
tmux new-session -ADs0
```

On the remote host.

The tmux flags given to `new-session` are:

- `-A` makes `new-session` behave like `attach-session` if session-name already exists
- `-D` `-D` behaves like `-d` to `attach-session`
- `-s0` specifies a session name. Here `0` is given as the session name, which is also the default value.


## Final Thoughts

I've left out a few things that hasn't seen use in a while and probably don't even
work today.
